Mockup-To-Article
=================

##About
The purpose of this project was to practice formatting unformatted text in order to
replicate the design of a mock-up image. By doing so, basic HTML concepts were put to use
in a relevant and meaningful fashion.

##Collaboration
I am not particularly looking for any feedback as this project is complete and has been
submitted already. But, feel free to provide any input if you find something I missed.
